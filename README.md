Overview and concept:

I had a week to create a grid based game using Javascript, HTML and css. I chose to create the old school game connect 4, my game is quite simple its a two player game. 

Technologies used: 

HTML 

1. H1 consiting of the header 
2.  h2 id tag being the winner
3. div id being the board. 

CSS

1. using flex-box
2. colours for the counters 
3. and styling for the slots to appear as circles.


Javascript
1. click events for the counters
2. creatign set interval as I wanted to remove the text after a certain amount of time.


The approach taken: 

Day 1 - for my first project, my plan and wireframe help as i had a little direction as to how i needed to start, my understaidning on how to create a wireframe was quite limited which is quite evident with what was created.

Day 2: 
I created the grid on Javascript which was quite straight forward as I referred to the notes that I has made previously in class, as I also knew the width and row i had to create a variable for that too.

Day 3:
I then realised my wireframe/plan wasnt well thought through as i needed to alternate between the two counters which i done research for an there were resources online which made this do-able. 

Day 4: I created the function checkWinner which was the most challenging part of the game as I needed to make sure that if four connects are matching that the user is notified, which took me a few days to get the hang of it which i referred to alot of my resources from StackOverflow.

Day 5 & 6: After understanding how to create the Vertical and Horizontal checks the diagonal checks were a little different as the logic was a little more complicated after after looking into various articles i came across an article that explained the logic in a way i understood what to do.  

Day 7: DEADLINE DAY 
just making sure the final bits are done and the styling is how i see fit.

When the game starts:
its players ones turn, which is the red counter.



KeyLearnings: 
1. Learned how to use flexbox from scratch 
2. i used the alert pop up to notify the user that won. 

Challenges: 
1. One of my main challenges were displaying the four counters that won, what i faced wasas soon as the user wins the counters dissappear, which i believe is down the remove function that i created. However, when i uncommneted the remove function it then displays the counters but the game continues which i couldnt figure how to stop that from happening. 

2. second challenge was creating a set timer that dissappeared after 5 seconds. 

Future Improvements: 
1. I would like to make it more personal so a pop up of the username.
2. Create a prompt so the user can add their name.
