Overview and concept:

I had a week to create a grid based game using Javascript, HTML and css. I chose to create the old school game connect 4, my game is quite simple its a two player game. 

Technologies used: 

**HTML**

1. H1 consisting of the header
2. H2 ID tag being the winner
3. DIV ID being the board.

**CSS**
1. Using flex-box
2. colours for the counters Red and Blue
3. Styling for the slots to appear as circles.

**Javascript**
1. Starting with the first red counter first
2. understanding that I had to create an empty board and cells array and aldso track them.

**The approach taken:**


**Day 1:** - for my first project, my plan and wireframe help as I had a little direction as to how I needed to start, my understanding on how to create a wireframe was quite limited which is quite evident with what was created.

**Day 2:** I created the grid in Javascript which was quite straight forward as I referred to the notes that I has made previously in class, as I also knew the width and row I had to create a variable for that too.

**Day 3:** I then realised my wireframe/plan wasn't well thought through as I needed to alternate between the two counters which I did research for and there were resources online which made this do-able.

**Day 4:** I created the function checkWinner which was the most challenging part of the game as I needed to make sure that if four connects are matching that the user is notified, which took me a few days to get the hang of it which I referred to a lot of my resources from StackOverflow.

**Day 5 & 6:** After understanding how to create the Vertical and Horizontal checks the diagonal checks were a little different as the logic was a little more complicated. After looking into various articles I came across an article that explained the logic in a way I understood what to do.

**Day 7:** DEADLINE DAY just making sure the final bits are done and the styling is how i see fit.

When the game starts: its players turn, which is the red counter.

**KeyLearnings:**

Learned how to use Flexbox from scratch

I used the alert pop up to notify the user that won.

**Challenges:**

**1.** One of my main challenges was displaying the four counters that won. What I faced was as soon as the user wins the counters disappear, which i believe is down to the remove function that i created. However, when I uncommented the remove function it then displayed the counters but the game continued so I couldn't figure out how to stop that from happening.

**2.** The second challenge was creating a set timer that disappeared after 5 seconds.

**Future Improvements:**

**1.** I would like to make it more personal so a pop up of the username.

**2.** Create a prompt so the user can add their
